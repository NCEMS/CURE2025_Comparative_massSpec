    "## What Is Mass Spectrometry?\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, **mass spectrometry** is an analytical technique that measures the **mass-to-charge ratio (m/z)** of ionized molecules. In proteomics, MS is used to analyze peptides and proteins after enzymatic digestion (typically with trypsin), producing characteristic **mass spectra** that act as molecular fingerprints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up Proteomics\n",
    "\n",
    "Mass spectrometry-based proteomics can be broadly divided into **bottom-up** and **top-down** approaches, each offering unique strengths and challenges depending on the biological question:  \n",
    "![Top-down Vs. Bottom-up proteomics](../../images/TopdownVBottomup.webp)   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bottom-Up Proteomics (BUP)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**: Proteins are enzymatically digested (e.g., with trypsin) into peptides before MS analysis.\n",
    "* **Advantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * High sensitivity and scalability.\n",
    "  * Amenable to complex samples (e.g., tissues, biofluids).\n",
    "  * Compatible with isobaric labeling for **quantitative comparisons**.\n",
    "* **Limitations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Loses information about **intact proteoforms** (e.g., isoforms, co-occurring PTMs).\n",
    "  * **Protein inference** is sometimes ambiguous (many peptides map to multiple proteins).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Top-Down Proteomics (TDP)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**: Intact proteins are directly ionized and analyzed without prior digestion.\n",
    "* **Advantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Preserves the **complete proteoform** — including sequence variants, splice isoforms, and multiple PTMs on a single molecule.\n",
    "  * Ideal for studying **post-translational modification crosstalk**, proteoform diversity, and protein complexes.\n",
    "* **Limitations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Lower throughput and dynamic range.\n",
    "  * Challenging for high-mass proteins or highly complex mixtures.\n",
    "  * Requires high-resolution instruments and specialized fragmentation techniques (e.g., ETD, ECD).\n",
